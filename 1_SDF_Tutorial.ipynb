    "## Step 2: Data Preparation and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training our neural network, we need to prepare high-quality training data. This step is crucial for successful SDF learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Our Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔧 Normalize the mesh**: Center at origin and scale for numerical stability\n",
    "2. **✂️ Create 2D slice**: Simplify 3D→2D for this tutorial\n",
    "3. **🎲 Sample training points**: Generate diverse coordinate samples\n",
    "4. **📏 Compute ground truth SDFs**: Calculate true signed distances\n",
    "5. **📊 Visualize the data**: Inspect our training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normalize?\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔢 Numerical Stability**: \n",
    "- Neural networks train best with inputs in consistent ranges (e.g., [-1, 1])\n",
    "- Large coordinate values can cause gradient instability and slow convergence\n",
    "- Normalization ensures all features have similar scales\n",
    "\n",
    "**📐 Scale Consistency**:\n",
    "- Makes the problem scale-invariant\n",
    "- Network learns relative distances, not absolute measurements\n",
    "- Easier to transfer knowledge between different sized objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Smart Training Data Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: We need point-SDF pairs to train our network, but we only have a surface mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Solution**: Sample points around the surface using strategic noise injection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with surface points → Known SDF = 0\n",
    "2. Add small noise → Points near surface with small |SDF|  \n",
    "3. Add larger noise → Points far from surface with large |SDF|\n",
    "4. Add uniform samples → Better coverage of the spatial domain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 Three-Part Sampling Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🎯 Close points** (σ = 0.01): Dense sampling near surface\n",
    "   - Ensures accurate surface boundary learning\n",
    "   - High density where precision matters most\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🌍 Far points** (σ = 0.075): Broader spatial coverage  \n",
    "   - Teaches inside/outside classification\n",
    "   - Provides context about distance gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🎲 Uniform points**: Random spatial coverage\n",
    "   - Prevents overfitting to surface-centric distribution\n",
    "   - Improves generalization across the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **Surface fidelity**: Dense near-surface samples capture fine details\n",
    "- **Spatial coverage**: Broader sampling teaches global SDF structure  \n",
    "- **Balanced learning**: Network learns both precise distances AND correct signs\n"

    "## Step 3: Neural Network Architecture and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll design and train a neural network to learn the implicit surface representation. This is where the magic happens – we're teaching the network to become a continuous SDF function!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our network is a simple but powerful feedforward neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: (x, z) coordinates → Hidden Layer 1 → Hidden Layer 2 → Output: SDF value\n",
    "       2D coordinates      32 neurons      32 neurons     1 scalar (distance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network IS the SDF function**: Once trained, `model(x, z)` returns the signed distance to the surface at coordinate (x, z).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Design Choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Why These Architecture Decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input dimension**: 2D (x,z) instead of 3D simplifies learning while demonstrating core concepts\n",
    "2. **Hidden size**: 32 neurons provide sufficient capacity without overfitting on our 40K samples\n",
    "3. **Activation**: ReLU creates non-linear decision boundaries essential for complex shapes\n",
    "4. **Output**: No final activation → continuous real-valued SDF predictions\n",
    "5. **Depth**: 2 hidden layers balance expressiveness with training stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Experiment Ideas:**\n",
    "- Try different activations: `Tanh`, `Sigmoid`, `Swish` - how do they affect surface smoothness?\n",
    "- Modify architecture: More layers? Wider networks? Skip connections?\n",
    "- Add positional encoding for better high-frequency detail capture?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Strategy & Loss Function Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)**\n",
    "- **Why L1?** Preserves sharp surface features better than L2/MSE\n",
    "- **L2 tends to blur** → smooth but less accurate surfaces  \n",
    "- **L1 preserves detail** → sharper, more accurate reconstructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Advanced Loss Ideas to Try:**\n",
    "- **Weighted L1**: Higher weights for points near surface (|SDF| < threshold)\n",
    "- **Sign-aware loss**: Extra penalty for wrong inside/outside classification\n",
    "- **Eikonal loss**: Regularize SDF gradients to have unit magnitude (proper distance field property)\n",
    "- **Multi-scale loss**: Train on multiple resolutions simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚙️ Training Configuration:**\n",
    "- **Optimizer**: Adam with adaptive learning rates (robust for coordinate networks)\n",
    "- **Batch size**: 500 points for good gradient estimates without memory issues\n",
    "- **SDF clipping**: Focus learning on surface proximity (±0.1 units)\n",
    "- **Data shuffling**: Prevents overfitting to specific point sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 What to Watch During Training:**\n",
    "- **Decreasing loss**: Network learning the coordinate→SDF mapping\n",
    "- **Convergence speed**: Should reach <0.01 loss within 100-200 epochs\n",
    "- **Loss plateaus**: May indicate need for learning rate adjustment or architecture changes \n",

    "    - This could be thought of/can be used to re-create an image.\n",
    "    - However, we do not need to query on an explicit grid. We can query anywhere in space. \n",

    "5. **Compare** with the original surface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Results:\n",

    "- **Positive SDF values (red/warm colors)**: Points outside the bone  \n",
    "- **Values near zero**: Points close to the surface boundary\n",
    "- **Zero level set**: The reconstructed surface where SDF = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "### Visualization tips: \n",
    "- The default colormap is viridis (purple to yellow). \n",
    "- The colormap that is blue to red with white in the middle does well for visualizing the SDF field.\n",
    "- Look at the range of values, often it is not symmetric. It helps to make it the min/max be -0.1 to 0.1 to help visualization. \n",
