    "## Step 2: Data Preparation and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training our neural network, we need to prepare high-quality training data. This step is crucial for successful SDF learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Our Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîß Normalize the mesh**: Center at origin and scale for numerical stability\n",

    "4. **üìè Compute ground truth SDFs**: Calculate true signed distances\n",
    "5. **üìä Visualize the data**: Inspect our training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normalize?\n",
    "\n",
    "**üî¢ Numerical Stability**: \n",
    "- Neural networks train best with inputs in consistent ranges (e.g., [-1, 1])\n",
    "- Large coordinate values can cause gradient instability and slow convergence\n",
    "- Normalization ensures all features have similar scales\n",
    "\n",
    "**üìê Scale Consistency**:\n",
    "- Makes the problem scale-invariant\n",
    "- Network learns relative distances, not absolute measurements\n",
    "- Easier to transfer knowledge between different sized objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Smart Training Data Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: We need point-SDF pairs to train our network, but we only have a surface mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Solution**: Sample points around the surface using strategic noise injection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with surface points ‚Üí Known SDF = 0\n",
    "2. Add small noise ‚Üí Points near surface with small |SDF|  \n",
    "3. Add larger noise ‚Üí Points far from surface with large |SDF|\n",
    "4. Add uniform samples ‚Üí Better coverage of the spatial domain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**üìä Three-Part Sampling Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üéØ Close points** (œÉ = 0.01): Dense sampling near surface\n",
    "   - Ensures accurate surface boundary learning\n",
    "   - High density where precision matters most\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **üåç Far points** (œÉ = 0.075): Broader spatial coverage  \n",
    "   - Teaches inside/outside classification\n",
    "   - Provides context about distance gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üé≤ Uniform points**: Random spatial coverage\n",
    "   - Prevents overfitting to surface-centric distribution\n",
    "   - Improves generalization across the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "**üí° Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **Surface fidelity**: Dense near-surface samples capture fine details\n",
    "- **Spatial coverage**: Broader sampling teaches global SDF structure  \n",
    "- **Balanced learning**: Network learns both precise distances AND correct signs\n"

    "### Key Design Choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**üéØ Why These Architecture Decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input dimension**: 2D (x,z) instead of 3D simplifies learning while demonstrating core concepts\n",
    "2. **Hidden size**: 32 neurons provide sufficient capacity without overfitting on our 40K samples\n",
    "3. **Activation**: ReLU creates non-linear decision boundaries essential for complex shapes\n",
    "4. **Output**: No final activation ‚Üí continuous real-valued SDF predictions\n",
    "5. **Depth**: 2 hidden layers balance expressiveness with training stability\n",

    "- Try different activations: `Tanh`, `Sigmoid`, `Swish` - how do they affect surface smoothness?\n",
    "    or learning convergence, etc. \n",
    "- Modify architecture: More layers? Wider networks? Skip connections?\n",
    "- Add positional encoding for better high-frequency detail capture?\n",
    "    - Convert 2D input into a higher dimensional representation of position. \n",

    "### Training Strategy & Loss Function Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**üéØ L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)**\n",

    "- **L1 preserves detail** ‚Üí sharper, more accurate reconstructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**üöÄ Advanced Loss Ideas to Try:**\n",
    "- **Weighted L1**: Higher weights for points near surface (|SDF| < threshold)\n",
    "- **Sign-aware loss**: Extra penalty for wrong inside/outside classification\n",
    "- **Eikonal loss**: Regularize SDF gradients to have unit magnitude (proper distance field property)\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚öôÔ∏è Training Configuration:**\n",
    "- **Optimizer**: Adam with adaptive learning rates (robust for coordinate networks)\n",
    "- **Batch size**: 500 points for good gradient estimates without memory issues\n",

    "Our network should now be trained to map coordinates to signed distance values. \n",

    "\n",
    "### What we'll do:\n",
    "1. **Create a dense grid** of query points across our 2D slice\n",
    "    - This could be thought of/can be used to re-create an image.\n",
    "    - However, we do not need to query on an explicit grid. We can query anywhere in space. \n",
    "2. **Predict SDF values** for each grid point using our trained network\n",
    "3. **Visualize the learned SDF field** as colored points\n",
    "4. **Extract the surface** using marching cubes on the zero level \n",
    "    set (where SD crosses from (-) to (+))\n",
    "5. **Compare** with the original surface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Results:\n",
    "- **Negative SDF values**: Points inside the bone\n",
    "- **Positive SDF values**: Points outside the bone  \n",
    "- **Values near zero**: Points close to the surface boundary\n",
    "- **Zero level set**: The reconstructed surface where SDF = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of our implicit representation depends on how well the network \n",
    "learned these relationships!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization tips: \n",
    "- The default colormap is viridis (purple to yellow). \n",
    "- The colormap that is blue to red with white in the middle does well for visualizing the SDF field.\n",
    "- Look at the range of values, often it is not symmetric. It helps to make it the min/max be -0.1 to 0.1 to help visualization the colormap. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Note:**  \n",
    "The network size and training parameters were chosen for efficient model fitting in this tutorial. The reconstructed surfaces are not \n",
    "exact and can be improved. After running the tutorial, try experimenting with different parameters to optimize the results.\n"
